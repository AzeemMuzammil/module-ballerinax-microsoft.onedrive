# Introduction
## What is Microsoft OneDrive?
[Microsoft OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage) is a file hosting 
service and synchronization service operated by Microsoft as part of its web version of Office. It provides 5 GB of space for free to anyone with a Microsoft account. OneDriveâ€™s starter tier allows storage, document editing, and collaboration via Office Online. For Windows 10 users, OneDrive is embedded in the operating system by default.<br/>  
OneDrive allows you to save files, photos, and other documents across multiple devices. You can also save your files in OneDrive and have them automatically sync to other devices, which means someone can access and work on the same document in multiple locations. OneDrive provides relatively easy access to cloud storage space, allowing options to share content with others. OneDrive integrates with Microsoft Office so that you can access Word, Excel, and Powerpoint documents from OneDrive. It does not require a download because it is already a part of Windows 10.

- Capability to share content across teams, large or small.  
- Customizable sync experience (for admins). 
- Secure storage of files and information.  
- Multimedia support. 
- Tight integration with other Microsoft products (including Microsoft 365).  

## Connector overview
Ballerina connector for Microsoft OneDrive connects to the OneDrive file storage API in Microsoft Graph v1.0 via Ballerina language. The connector allows you to programmatically perform basic drive functionalities such as file upload, download. It also allows you to share files and folders stored on Microsoft OneDrive.<br/>
The connector is developed on top of Microsoft Graph API, which is a REST API that empowers you to access Microsoft Cloud service resources. This version of the connector only supports access to resources and information corresponding to a specific Microsoft account (currently, it is the signed-in user account).

# Compatibility and limitations
## Compatibility
- Ballerina language version: Swan Lake Beta 1
- [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview) version: 1.0 


## Limitations
- Allows performing functions only on behalf of the currently signed-in user.
- Only supports access to operations available in the corresponding personal Microsoft account.

# Prerequisites
- A Microsoft OneDrive account
- An Azure account that has an active subscription (you can use your persona, work, or school account)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 installed
- [Ballerina SL Beta 1](https://ballerina.io/learn/user-guide/getting-started/setting-up-ballerina/installation-options/) installed

# Configure the connector
## Obtain tokens

To use the connector, you need an access token with information about your application and its permission to access resources and APIs available through Microsoft Graph.<br/> 
To get an access token, you must register your application with the Microsoft identity platform and get it authorized by either a user or an administrator to access the Microsoft Graph resources it needs.<br/>
For your application to get a token from the Microsoft identity platform, you must register it in the Azure portal. Registration integrates your application with the Microsoft identity platform to establish a trust relationship to get the following details:
- Application ID
- Redirect URL
- Application Secret

Follow these steps to register your application and get the required details:

**Step 1:** Register a new application in your Azure AD tenant

Follow this procedure to register your application and get the Application (client) ID:

   1. On the Application registrations page, click **New registration** and enter an appropriate display name for your application.
   2. In the **Supported account types** section, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g., Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com)** or **Personal Microsoft accounts only**. 
   3. Provide a **Redirect URI** if necessary.
   4. Click **Register**. 

       ![Obtaining Credentials Step 1](docs/images/s1.png)
   5. Copy the Application (client) ID to a text file to use as the value of `<MS_CLIENT_ID>`, which is the unique identifier for your application.

       ![Obtaining Credentials Step 1](docs/images/s2.png)

**Step 2:** Create a new client secret

Follow this procedure to get the client secret for your application:

   1. Under **Manage**, click **Certificates & secrets**.
   2. In the **Client secrets** section, click **New client secret**.
   3. Enter an appropriate description and expiration date for the new client secret.
   4. Click **Add**.
   5. Copy the client secret to a text file to use as the value of `<MS_CLIENT_SECRET>`.

       ![Obtaining Credentials Step 2](docs/images/s3.png)

**Step 3:** Add scopes and permission

In an OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0 authorization request, an application can request necessary permission using the scope query parameter. When it comes to Microsoft resources, some of the high-privilege admin-restricted permissions require an organization's administrator consent on behalf of organization users.<br/>
If you require such permission, be sure to request and get the appropriate permission.
   
  ![Obtaining Credentials Step 3](docs/images/s4.png)


**Step 4:** Obtain the access token and refresh token

Follow this procedure to get the access token, and refresh token:

   1. In the Overview of the application, click the **Endpoints** tab to view its authorization endpoint and token endpoint.
   2. Copy the **OAuth 2.0 token endpoint (v2)** value to a text file to use as the value of `<MS_REFRESH_URL>`.

       ![Obtaining Credentials Step 4](docs/images/s5.png)

   3. In a new browser, enter the URL as follows and replace `<MS_CLIENT_ID>` with the application ID you obtained in Step 1.

       ```
       https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=<MS_CLIENT_ID>&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/browser-callback&response_mode=query&scope=openid offline_access <SPACE_SEPERATED_LIST_OF_SCOPES>
       ```
    
      This prompts for the username and password to sign in to the Azure Portal application.

   4. Enter the username and password. This takes you to a URL as follows:
        ```
        https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient?code=M95780001-0fb3-d138-6aa2-0be59d402f32
        ```
   5. Copy the code parameter (here it is M95780001-0fb3-d138-6aa2-0be59d402f32) to a text file to use as the value of `<MS_REFRESH_URL>` in the project configuration file.
   6. In a new terminal enter the following cURL command: 
      **Note**: Be sure to replace <MS_CODE>, <MS_CLIENT_ID>, and <MS_CLIENT_SECRET> with appropriate values you obtained in the steps above.
        ```
        curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --header "Host:login.microsoftonline.com" -d "client_id=<MS_CLIENT_ID>&client_secret=<MS_CLIENT_SECRET>&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient&code=<MS_CODE>&scope=Files.ReadWrite openid User.Read Mail.Send Mail.ReadWrite offline_access" https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token
        ```
        
     The cURL command results in a response as follows with the values for `<MS_ACCESS_TOKEN>` and `<MS_REFRESH_TOKEN>`:
        ```
        {
            "token_type": "Bearer",
            "scope": "openid <LIST_OF_PERMISSIONS>",
            "expires_in": 3600,
            "ext_expires_in": 3600,
            "access_token": "<MS_ACCESS_TOKEN>",
            "refresh_token": "<MS_REFRESH_TOKEN>",
            "id_token": "<ID_TOKEN>"
        }
        ```
        Copy the values of `<MS_ACCESS_TOKEN>` and `<MS_REFRESH_TOKEN> to a text file to use in the project configuration file.
        
For more information on OAuth2 tokens, see [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2) and [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols on the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols#endpoints)<br/>

## Add the project configuration file

Follow this procedure:

1. Create a file named `config.toml` under the root path of the project structure.
2. Add the following configuration to the file:
  **Note**: Replace the placeholders with appropriate values you obtained by following the steps under [Obtain tokens](#obtain-tokens).


#### config.toml
```ballerina
[ballerinax.microsoft.onedrive]
refreshUrl = <MS_REFRESH_URL>
refreshToken = <MS_REFRESH_TOKEN>
clientId = <MS_CLIENT_ID>
